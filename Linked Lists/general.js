// Linked Lists -- apples -> grapes -> pears

//Js doesnt come with linked lists built in

/**
 * Singly vs Doubly linked list
 *
 * Singly - Easier to implement, cannot be iterated in reverse, if we lose the referece of
 * this.head we cant find it again
 *
 * Doubly - can be traversed, front or back. Also can easily delete the prev node.
 * Fairly complex to implement, requires more memory.
 * Good operation for searching for elements
